## Business Problem
* Every year, millions of people across the globe are affected by preventable or treatable diseases — but not everyone has the same access    to healthcare, treatment, or recovery. Some countries have strong healthcare systems but still struggle with recovery rates. Others have    low access to care but surprisingly high resilience. 
* There’s clearly a gap — but where exactly is it, and what’s driving it?
* This project explores global health data to uncover patterns and disparities in disease prevalence, healthcare access, treatment            availability, recovery rates, and the impact of socio-economic factors like income, education, and urbanization.

## Business Questions
**1. Which diseases are affecting the most people, and where?**

**2. Is higher healthcare access actually leading to better recovery?**

**3. Which countries are spending more on treatment, and is it worth it?**

**4. How much does income or education impact health outcomes?**

## Insights and Recommendations

1. **Healthcare Access vs Recovery Rate by Country**

   **Insight:**
   Some countries with high healthcare access still have lower recovery rates (e.g., Japan), while others with moderate access show          better recovery (e.g., South Korea)

   **Recommendation:**
   Governments should evaluate the efficiency of healthcare delivery, not just infrastructure. Focus on quality of care and early            intervention programs.

2. **Availability of Vaccines/Treatment Over Time by Disease Category**

   **Insight:**
   Communicable diseases have seen a steady increase in treatment availability, while non-communicable diseases lag behind.

   **Recommendation:**
   Invest in research and manufacturing for long-term disease management solutions, especially for chronic diseases like diabetes and        cancer.

3. **Total Population Affected by Disease Category**

   **Insight:**
   Non-communicable diseases affect the largest portion of the global population.

   **Recommendation:**
   Healthcare policies should prioritize prevention, lifestyle education, and routine screening programs to manage this growing burden.

4. **Average Treatment Cost by Disease/Country**

   **Insight:**
   Developed countries show higher average treatment costs, especially for critical diseases.

   **Recommendation:**
   Explore cost optimization strategies like bulk procurement, telemedicine, and insurance subsidies to reduce the financial load on         patients.
   
5. **Trend of Recovery Rate Over Years**

   **Insight:**
   There’s an overall improvement in recovery rates, but progress is inconsistent across regions.
   
   **Recommendation:**
   Countries with slower growth should analyze and adopt best practices from nations showing consistent improvement.
   
6. **Urbanization Rate vs Healthcare Access**

   **Insight:**
   Urbanized nations generally show better healthcare access, but rural coverage remains a gap.

   **Recommendation:**
   Governments should promote mobile clinics and digital health platforms to bridge rural healthcare gaps.
   
7. **Population Affected by Gender and Age Group**

   **Insight:**
   Women in certain regions and elderly populations are more affected by specific diseases.
   
   **Recommendation:**
   Design gender-sensitive and age-targeted health campaigns and screening programs.

8. **Education Index vs Recovery Rate**

   **Insight:**
   Countries with higher education index tend to show better recovery rates.
   
   **Recommendation:**
   Promote health education and awareness as part of school curricula and public outreach programs.

9. **Vaccination Availability vs Mortality Rate**

   **Insight:**
   Regions with low vaccine availability show higher mortality rates for preventable diseases.
   
   **Recommendation:**
   Strengthen global supply chains and immunization programs, especially in low-income countries.
  
10. **Per Capita Income vs Healthcare Access**

    **Insight:**
    Higher income doesn’t always guarantee better access — disparities exist even in rich countries.
   
    **Recommendation:**
    Enforce equitable healthcare distribution and regulate private sector pricing models.
